Phase 1
- add ct/t side marker X
- add long/short match marker - started in the add pistol round func
- convert df so a new row occurs per kill not per round
- separate df based on team
- run first classifier and plot probabilities to see if it makes sense
- add more data to improve results (incoproate long matches?)

Phase 2
- capture stills from live game 
- extract info to feed into model
- overlay onto match screen
