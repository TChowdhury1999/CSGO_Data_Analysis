# CSGO_Data_Analysis
Create live round winning probability overlay ingame for CSGO

Using data from csgo-stats.gg, a ML model will be trained that can provide a probability of winning a round/game of Counter-Strike Global Offensive. By reading in data from the scoreboard, an overlay can be displayed on screen to players.
